## PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
Use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Results:
The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

From this dataframe, we can conclude that:
-Highest count of rides in 2019 were in urban cities. The total rides and rural cities have the smallest proportion. 
Urban cities have the most amount of rides and drivers and rural cities have the least. As a result the city type Urban brings the most revenue as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of revenue.
