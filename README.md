## PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of the analysis:
Use Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Results:
The following key metrics were calculated and a dataframe was created to observe and analyze some disparities in city types.

From this dataframe, we can conclude that:

-Highest count of rides in 2019 were in urban cities. The total rides and rural cities have the smallest proportion. 

-Urban cities brings the most revenue as we can see in the Total Fares column and rural cities bring the least amount of revenue.

-The average fare per driver, from this data it can be seen that drivers in the rural city type make $55.49 per ride, whereas the drivers in urban areas make almost 3 times less per ride which is $16.57.

#### Total fare by city type from January to April 2019.

-Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. 

-Urban cities aslo seem to bring a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. 

-3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type showing increased demand at that time.

## Summary:
-Urban cities account for most of the revenue for the company due to highest total fare and most amount of rides and therefore . As a result this is the best performing city type. More investments should be made for PyBer in the future.

-Rural cities have the least amount of rides and fares among all the types. But the average fare per ride is the highest for this city type. So there is potential to increase revenue with a bit of ridership in rural cities. Here the average fare per driver is the highest and it could be easier to get drivers with proper investing and marketing. 

-Additional analysis including the geographic location, socio-economic conditions, and commuting distances will provide better insights for investing.
